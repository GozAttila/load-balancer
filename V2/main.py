# As I found not too satisfying the previous version, I dive a little bit deeper into this with python, but what I found
# didn't make me happy. If I want returning value, then I can use only blocking codes. If I want to use background
# functions, I cannot return value. None of it is good for me. Albeit I didn't try it with multiprocess, as I found no
# solution (in Windows) to create a callable function. In the previous version, I had to decide between blocking or no
# returning, and I chose blocking (to change it to no returning, I just have to comment out the join part).
# Here, I tried something different. Two separated functions to feed requests and to receive results. Queues to handle
# requests/results. Using Threads in the provider. No Heartbeat checker -> a callback function handle this in real time,
# no waiting for the Heartbeat checker tick. When a provider queue is full, set it's availability to False in the
# Load balancers provider list, and turn it back to True when the list become empty.
#
# Update: I had a misunderstanding about the real function of the Heartbeat. Added Heartbeat function.
